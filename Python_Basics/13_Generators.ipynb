    "A Python generator is a function that produces a sequence of values, one at a time. It does this by using the `yield` keyword. The *yield* keyword is similar to the *return* keyword, but instead of returning a value and ending the function, it pauses the function and returns a value. The function can then be resumed by calling the `next()` function on the generator object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generators are useful for producing sequences of values that are too large to be stored in memory all at once. For example, we could use a generator to produce the Fibonacci sequence, which is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. The Fibonacci sequence grows very quickly, so it would not be possible to store all of the numbers in memory at once. However, a generator can be used to produce the Fibonacci sequence one number at a time, which is much more efficient."

The iterator object can be iterated over to produce the values generated by the function. This can be done using a `for` loop, or by calling the `next()` function on the iterator object.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the iterator object is first iterated over, the generator function starts executing the function body. However, the function body only executes until it reaches the first `yield` statement. At this point, the function returns the value of the `yield` expression and pauses execution. After that it will throw an `StopIteration` error.\n",
