The Child And The Candle
Allama Iqbal

O Child with moth-like nature , "How strange that
You keep gazing at the flame of the candle for hours
What is this movement, when you are in my lap?
Are you intending to embrace the light?
Though your tiny heart is surprised at this spectacle
But this is recognition of some object already seen!
The candle is but a flame, you are the Light embodied
Ah! In this assembly that is manifest, you are concealed
It is not known why the Nature's hand made it manifest!
And concealed you in the dark soil's mantle
Your light has been concealed under the veil of Intellect! 
The veil of Cognition is a mere mist to the wise eye!
