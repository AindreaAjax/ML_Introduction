   "source": [
    "1. Keep time in mind. Average attention span is 5-20 minutes. We also need some time at the end for questions.\n",
    "2. It's better to have many slides with little content on each, making for a more dynamic presentation, rather than few slides with lots of content. we should have one message per slide. It will keep things short and fluid. Lessen the cognitive load on the audience as much as possible.\n",
    "3. So as far as colors are concerned, we use the least amount of colors needed to convey our message. Also, we should maintain a good contrast between your text and background, to help readability. We also need to be attentive to potentially impaired auditors. People who have color-vision deficiency can't distinguish between two different colors, so those people will struggle to understand the text or graph on the slides if you use green and red together. \n",
    "4. Fonts also impact readability. The rule of thumb would be \"sans-serif\" is appropriate for text that will be read on a screen, and \"serif\" is appropriate for text that will be printed. The font choice is also contextual. Usually, texts are hard to read not because of the font choice, but because they are long texts in a small size. Let's keep our texts short and big instead. Use bold and italics to get your point across but do not overuse them.\n",
    "5. Including too much text can have a negative impact. The audience tends to read the slide instead of listening. Break down the text into bullet points. Use a concise and specific heading. You can also consider using a visual instead of text.\n",
    "6. Use layering to reveal information progressively. It helps the audience focus on the current topic. You can use layering for texts as well as visuals."
