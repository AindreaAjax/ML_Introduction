    "The record linkage workflow involves a series of well-defined steps, from data preparation and blocking to comparison, classification, evaluation, and potential postprocessing. The aim is to identify record pairs that likely represent the same entities across two datasets while minimizing false positives and false negatives. The choice of methods and thresholds may vary depending on the specific requirements of the record linkage task.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preprocessing:**\n",
    "   - Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess the datasets to ensure consistency and uniformity. This may involve standardizing formats, handling missing values, and removing duplicates within each dataset.\n",
    "   - Data Transformation: Convert and format the data, if necessary, to ensure compatibility between the two datasets. Ensure that the data types and structures align.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Indexing (Blocking):**\n",
    "   - Blocking: Create blocks or groups of records within each dataset based on specific attributes or criteria. The goal is to reduce the number of record pairs that need to be compared. Common blocking methods include sorting, hashing, or using range-based criteria, such as the first few characters of an attribute like \"Address.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparing:**\n",
    "   - Comparison: Within each block, compare the records based on selected similarity criteria. This involves comparing attribute values (e.g., \"Name,\" \"Age\") and applying similarity metrics such as string distance measures (e.g., Levenshtein distance) for text fields.\n",
    "   - Scoring: Assign a similarity score to each pair of records within the block to quantify how similar they are based on the chosen criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Classifying (Thresholding):**\n",
    "   - Thresholding: Define a threshold for the similarity score above which record pairs are considered potential matches. Record pairs with similarity scores below this threshold are classified as non-matches.\n",
    "   - Classification: Based on the threshold, classify the record pairs within each block into two categories: matches and non-matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluation:**\n",
    "   - Ground Truth: If available, use a ground truth or labeled dataset that indicates which record pairs are true matches and non-matches. This is used for evaluating the accuracy of your record linkage process.\n",
    "   - Performance Metrics: Calculate performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy to assess the quality of the record linkage results.\n",
    "   - Iteration: Depending on the evaluation results, you may iterate on the threshold or the choice of similarity criteria to optimize the linkage process for your specific use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Postprocessing (Optional):**\n",
    "   - If needed, perform postprocessing steps to further refine the matched results. This might involve handling cases of potential duplicates within the matched pairs or dealing with data integration challenges.\n"
