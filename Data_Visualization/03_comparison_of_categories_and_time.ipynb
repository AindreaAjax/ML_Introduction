    "    - If one of your data dimensions is **time** — including years, quarters, months, weeks, days, or hours — you should always set the time dimension **on the horizontal axis**.\n",
    "    - In charts, time should always run from left to right, never from top to bottom.\n",
    "    - For bar charts, the **numerical axis must start at zero**. Our eyes are very sensitive to the height of columns, and we can draw inaccurate conclusions when those bars are truncated.\n",
    "    - Avoid using pattern lines or fills. Use a border only for highlights.\n",
    "    - Only use bar charts to show trends if there are a reasonably-low number of data points (less than 20) and if every data point has a clearly-visible value."
