How much do they need to understand to drive change? Explaining why we chose the variables to predict is not useful for a non-tech person, we should explain the context in which our model works. Our story should help the audience understand what our project is about, what change needs to be made for tangible outcomes. Listing the correlation coefficients could be overwhelming, it's better to explain the interaction between the variables (how they depend on each other, what will happen to the other if we change one etc).

Or if we are explaining how our model predicts an outcome, we should focus on the benefits, such as financial benefits."
