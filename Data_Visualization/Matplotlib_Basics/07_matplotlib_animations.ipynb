It is often more convenient to provide the arguments to the *func* function using `functools.partial()`. In this way it is also possible to pass keyword arguments. To pass a function with both positional and keyword arguments, set all arguments as keyword arguments, just leaving the frame argument unset e.g:\n",

    "    - If an iterable, then simply use the values provided.\n",
    "    - If an integer, then equivalent to passing *range(frames)*\n",
    "    - If a generator function, then must have the signature, *def gen_function() -> obj*\n",
    "    - If None, then equivalent to passing *itertools.count*\n",

For example, when we use Axes.barh to plot a bar-chart, it creates a number of artists for each of the bar and error bars. To update the plot, one would need to update each of the bars from the container individually and redraw them. Instead, `animation.ArtistAnimation` can be used to plot each frame individually and then stitched together to form an animation."
