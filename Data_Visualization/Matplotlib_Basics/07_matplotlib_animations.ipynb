It is often more convenient to provide the arguments to the *func* function using `functools.partial()`. In this way it is also possible to pass keyword arguments. To pass a function with both positional and keyword arguments, set all arguments as keyword arguments, just leaving the frame argument unset e.g:\n",

    "    - If an iterable, then simply use the values provided.\n",
    "    - If an integer, then equivalent to passing *range(frames)*\n",
    "    - If a generator function, then must have the signature, *def gen_function() -> obj*\n",
    "    - If None, then equivalent to passing *itertools.count*\n",

To update the plot, one would need to update each of the bars from the container individually and redraw them.
