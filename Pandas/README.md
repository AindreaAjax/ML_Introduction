# Pandas
--------------------------

## Resources used:
- Pandas official documentation
- [Book] Effective pandas by, Matt Harrison (Some chapters were skipped)
Primarily I've depended on these two resources. Most of the datasets used in learning pandas was also collected from Matt's github repo named datasets. Some screenshots of the tables summarizing the available methods and properties of some functions were used inside the notebooks (to be specific 2 screenshots till now).

## Future prospect:
- [Book] Data Cleaning Examples throughout different chapters of the book (Effective pandas by, Matt Harrison).
    - Dirty devil dataset
    - Siena president survey dataset
    - Jetbrains developer dataset etc.

- ./02_Reading_and_writing_data.ipynb: Learn how to interact with various file types such as, CSV, JSON, SQL, Excel, Feather, Parquet etc.

- ./05_Plotting.ipynb: Learn to draw various types of plots and their use cases.
