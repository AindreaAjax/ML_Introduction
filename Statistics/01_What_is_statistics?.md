# What is statistics?
Statistics can be defined as the collection and interpretation of data. 

There are many angles from which we can look at statistics. For example we can talk about,
- The field of statistics, which is the practice and study of collecting and analyzing data. 
- or, Summary statistic, which is a fact about or summary of some data, like an average or a count. 

A more important question, however, is what can statistics do? With the power of statistics, we can answer tons of different questions like: 
- How likely is someone to purchase a product? 
- Are people more likely to purchase it if they can use a different payment system? 
- How many occupants will your hotel have? How can you optimize occupancy? 
- How many sizes of jeans need to be manufactured so they can fit 95% of the population? 
- Should the same number of each size be produced? 
- A question like, Which ad is more effective in getting people to purchase a product? can be answered with A/B testing. 


While statistics can answer a lot of questions, it's important to note that statistics can't answer every question. If we want to know why the TV series Game of Thrones is so popular, we could ask everyone why they like it, but they may lie or leave out reasons. We can see if series with more violent scenes attract more viewers, but even if they do, we can't know if the violence in Game of Thrones is the reason for its popularity, or if other factors are driving its popularity and it just happens to be violent. 


# Types of statistics
There are 2 main branches of statistics: descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. 

Before we learn more about them let's first familiarize ourselves with some key definitions.

## Some key definitions

- **Population**: The total amount of things. We say things because it can be anything e.g. people, animals, plants, or anything else.
  
- **Sample**: A sample is a small portion or the population that was used for the study. The total amount of things in a sample is called the sample size.

- **Variables**: A variable is a characteristic of a population/sample that we are trying to study. It can be measured or observed, counted and categorized. For example, the height, weight, hair color of a person are all variables.

## Descriptive statistics

Descriptive statistics **focuses on describing and summarizing** the data at hand. For example the following question can be answered with descriptive statistics.
  - given data on every customer service requests made, what's the average time it took to respond?

## Inferential statistics

Inferential statistics **uses the data at hand**, which is called sample data, **to make inferences about a larger population**. For example the following question can be answered with the help of inferential statistics.
  - after interviewing 100 customers, what percentage of all your customers are satisfied with the service? etc.

# Types of data

There are two main types of data. 

## Numeric data

**Numeric, or quantitative data** is made up of numeric values. Numeric data can be further separated into continuous and discrete data. 
   - **Continuous numeric** data is often quantities that can be measured, like speed or time. 
   - **Discrete numeric** data is usually count data, like number of pets or number of packages shipped.

## Categorical data

**Categorical, or qualitative data** is made up of values that belong to distinct groups. For example, the brand of a product or zip code of a district (even though zip codes are made up of numbers, they don't have any inherent ordering to them. If a variable can't be ordered, it must be categorical).

Categorical data can be nominal or ordinal. 

  - **Nominal categorical data** is made up of categories with no inherent ordering, like marriage status or country of residence. 
  - **Ordinal categorical data** has an inherent order, like a survey question where you need to indicate the degree to which you agree with a statement. 

Sometimes, categorical variables are represented using numbers. Married and unmarried can be represented using 1 and 0, or an agreement scale could be represented with numbers 1 through 5. However, it's important to note that this doesn't necessarily make them numeric variables. 

## Why does data type matter? 
Being able to identify data types is important since the type of data you're working with will dictate what kinds of summary statistics and visualizations make sense for your data, so this is an important skill to master. For numerical data, we can use summary statistics like mean, and plots like scatter plots, but these don't make a ton of sense for categorical data. Similarly, things like counts and barplots don't make much sense for numeric data.
