    "Usually when the sampling distribution is a normal distribution we use z-test. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For finding the *z-score* we use the following formula:\n",

    "One alternative is to use the sample standard deviation as an estimate for the population standard deviation. In this scenario we can't use the z-test, instead we use the **t-test** (due to increased uncertainty). Also the t-test is used only for the mean (usually of a numerical response variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another alternative is to create a bootstrap distribution from the sample and use that to estimate the standard error. This way we can still use the z-test. But the problem with this is, bootstrapping is computationally expensive and it is not always possible to create a bootstrap distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with these problems we use the **proportion tests**. In proportion tests we use a mathematical formula to calculate the standard error of the sample statistic (SE) instead of creating a bootstrap distribution. Also since we use the sample parameter only in the numerator and not to calculate SE in the denominator we can still use the *z-score* to measure how extreme out sample is."
